# Satellite-Data-Analysis
This project involves the preprocessing and visualization of the OCO-2 dataset, aimed at uncovering insights into atmospheric measurements denoted by columns `reg01` to `reg17`. Initially, the data was loaded from a CSV file, where a preliminary step was taken to remove the unit specification row, ensuring only relevant data was processed. Subsequently, columns containing the measurements were converted to numeric values to facilitate accurate computations and analysis. The date column, originally in an unconventional format, was converted into a proper date format to enable time series analysis. Rows with any missing values were then removed to maintain data integrity.

With the dataset cleaned and preprocessed, various visualization techniques were employed to extract meaningful patterns and relationships. A line plot was used to illustrate the trends of `reg01` to `reg17` over time, providing insights into long-term trends, seasonal variations, and any anomalies present in the dataset. This visualization is particularly useful in identifying consistent increases or decreases in measurements, which could signify underlying environmental changes. 

A scatter plot was created to map the geographical distribution of the data points, plotting longitude against latitude. This visualization helps in understanding the spatial distribution and identifying potential clusters or regions of interest. A heatmap of the correlation matrix was then generated to explore the relationships between different `reg` columns, revealing which variables are strongly correlated and suggesting potential underlying connections or common influencing factors. 

Pair plots were utilized to further delve into the pairwise relationships and distributions among the `reg` columns, aiding in the identification of linear or non-linear relationships, clusters, and outliers. Lastly, histograms of each `reg` column were plotted to examine the distribution of values, providing insights into central tendencies, dispersions, and any skewness or outliers present. 

Overall, this project successfully preprocesses the OCO-2 dataset and employs a suite of visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data's temporal, spatial, and inter-variable characteristics, thereby enabling informed analysis and decision-making.
